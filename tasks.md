Please create an envelope budgeting app that does the following:
- Shows me a list of categories with a balance on each one
- I can create a new category with a name
- At the top, I have current income balance and I can click it to adjust the income
- I can click a category to either “adjust budget” or “spend”. If I adjust the budget, the amount I add is subtracted from income. If I spend, the amount is subtracted from the category.
